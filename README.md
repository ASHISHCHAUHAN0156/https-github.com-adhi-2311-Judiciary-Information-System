We aim to design a Judiciary Information System (JIS) that:
a. implements a user-friendly system for case registration, creation and modification.
b. The information entered by the registrar is properly stored and then displayed for private access to only registered users.
c. To create a database to store, manage and backup case records.
d. To search for a specific case record by entering known data.


This is a CRUD app built using Nodejs,Express js, Mongodb and HTML(EJS),CSS and Javascript.
